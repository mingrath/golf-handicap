## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Data integrity first -- foundation phase before any feature work to prevent corrupted historical data
- [Roadmap]: Two-store separation -- game store and history store with independent versioning
- [Roadmap]: IndexedDB via Dexie for history storage (localStorage 5 MB limit insufficient)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flagged Phase 2/3 may need `/gsd:research-phase` for mobile input UX patterns (outdoor use, sun glare, one-handed operation)
