<current_state>

</current_state>

<completed_work>

- v1.3 Phase 15: Manual Handicap Hole Selection -- inline hole toggle grid in HandicapEditDialog with smart preserve/trim logic (HCTL-01/02/03)

- Milestone archived: milestones/v1.3-ROADMAP.md, milestones/v1.3-REQUIREMENTS.md
- PROJECT.md evolved: v1.3 Active requirements moved to Validated, Current State section updated, Key Decisions added
- ROADMAP.md: v1.3 collapsed into details block
- REQUIREMENTS.md deleted (fresh for next milestone)
- Git tag v1.3 created and pushed
- All commits pushed to origin/main (Vercel auto-deploy)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- No remaining work in current milestone
- Next step: /gsd:new-milestone to start next feature cycle
- Backlog items for consideration: EXPORT-01 (JSON backup export), PWA-01 (persistent storage prompt)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Smart handicap change logic: preserve existing holes on value increase, trim from highest on decrease, auto-distribute only on fresh start or sign change
- Two-store bridge pattern: IndexedDB -> Zustand via loadHistoryGame, edits -> IndexedDB via history-aware useSaveGame
- skipNextSave ref pattern to prevent redundant save-on-load when historyId transitions
- isHistoryMode derived from historyId !== null for conditional UI on results page
- resetGame() called before back navigation to clear loaded history state
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None.

<context>
All user feedback from v1.0 through v1.3 has been addressed. The app is feature-complete for the current user needs. The backlog has two items (JSON export, persistent storage prompt) but no user has requested them yet. Wait for next round of user feedback before planning v1.4.

118 tests passing across 6 test files. Build clean. Deployed on Vercel from main branch.

<next_action>
Start with: /gsd:new-milestone when ready for next feature cycle. Use /clear first for fresh context window. Gather new user feedback before defining requirements.
